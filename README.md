Lab 4: Design Descisions
===

An alternative look to SnapWhere.

The background color was changed from black to white for a less eerie look, and the text white to black to complement readability. All text is padded and aligned in the center so the reader can easily see it. A large button with a camera is included underneath this. As a camera and their function is immediately recognized, the purpose of our app becomes clear. It also adds a touch of snaze. When pressed, the button (hypothetically) becomes darker so the user knows that they have properly pressed it.

There is minimal text, variation of color, and in all a very simple and easy to use app.
